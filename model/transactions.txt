Transaction in bean editor
--------------------------

DBTransaction beanEditorDefaultTransaction in DbBeanEditor

final getBeanEditorDefaultTransaction() -> initialize and/or return transaction (+ check if transaction has been closed and then create a new one)

all functions in <Bean>Editor have a transaction version

non transaction functions:
1. are final
2. call the transaction functions with getBeanEditorDefaultTransaction as argument to the DBTransaction field



ALTERNATIVE :

wrapper function in DbBeanEditor or call to wrap in the bean

non transaction functions:
1. are final
2. wrap all function calls in the on-the-spot creation of a new DBTransaction


OR SIMPLY:

non transaction functions are final
