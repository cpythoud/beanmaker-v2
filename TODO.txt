1. select libraries to include in /lib folder:
    - integrate DbBean Utils directly (only used classes and only functions in use from these classes, unless
      a function is related to another one, then include it too)
    - update DbBeanSQL per the TODO list in that project,
    - merge DbBeanSQL Utils in Beanmaker Utils
    - HTML Codegen as is for now (extension & rewrite will come later)
    - Java Codegen as is for now (to be extended as required for this project, eventual move to Java 11)
    - Apache common-io + common-upload (most recent versions)
    - remove: password maker (replace uses with something that works)
    - remove: Apache POI (no Excel export from the table in first version, maybe reimplement later but coordinate
      with xnlab project)

2. copy and adjust version 1 source code
    - rename packages
    - remove unwanted code
    - produce a working/compilable version of beanmaker-utils-v2.jar first to use in point 3

3. hand code new version of classes in separate project Generation Test V2

4. adjust code generator until generated classes code corresponds to code written in step 3
