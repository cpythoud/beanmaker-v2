1. select libraries to include in /lib folder
    - integrate DbBean Utils directly (only used classes and only functions in use from these classes, unless
      function is related to another one, then include it to)
    - rewrite DbBeanSQL? (move to Java 11, functional interfaces only, merged with DbBeanSQL Utils?
      or directly integrated with this rewrite of BeanMaker?)
    - rewrite HTML Codegen? (move to Java 11 essentially)
    - rewrite Java Codegen? (move to Java 11)
    - include: Apache common-io + common-upload (most recent versions)
    - remove: password maker (replace uses with something that works)
    - remove: Apache POI (no Excel export from the table; or completely reimplement)

2. copy and adjust version 1 source code
    - rename packages
    - remove unwanted code
    - proceed to code modifications
